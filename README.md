<h1>ONE PLAZA RESTAURANT</h1>

<p>
This project is a restaurant website with multiple pages, including a homepage, an "About Us" page, a menu page, and a reservation page. The homepage welcomes visitors and provides quick links to reserve a table or order from the menu. The "About Us" page provides information about the restaurant's offerings, while the menu page showcases various dishes with descriptions and prices. The reservation page allows users to book a table by entering their details. The site uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and some basic JavaScript for interactivity.
